# CarbonNanotube-ExcitonEnergy

This repository solves the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) based on the tight binding model for a semiconducting carbon nanotube with chirality `(n,m)` and calculates excitonic energy states and wavefunctions for $E_{ii}$ excitons.

The code is written in the following languages in the chronological order (the last one being the most recent one):

* MATLAB
* Fortran
* C++

Therefore, different versions could be slightly different with the most recent one being probably the most compelete.

Look at `README.md` files in each folder for details of implementation and other info.
